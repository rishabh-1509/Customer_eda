# E-Commerce Transactions Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing an e-commerce transactions dataset consisting of three files:

- **Customers.csv**: Contains customer details.
- **Products.csv**: Contains product details.
- **Transactions.csv**: Contains transaction details.

The tasks include performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a Lookalike Model for customer recommendation, and customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

## Dataset Description
### Customers.csv
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **CustomerName**: Name of the customer.
- **Region**: Continent where the customer resides.
- **SignupDate**: Date when the customer signed up.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
Perform EDA on the provided dataset and derive actionable business insights.


### Task 2: Lookalike Model
Build a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model should:
- Recommend 3 similar customers for a given user.
- Assign a similarity score to each recommendation.

  

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques, utilizing both profile and transaction data.


## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language used.
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation.
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn: For visualization.
  - Scikit-learn: For modeling and clustering.
  - Any other relevant libraries as needed.
